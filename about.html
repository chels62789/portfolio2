      <!-- ABOUT TEXT -->
      <section class="abouttext">
          <h2>Growing Up</h2>
            <p>I enjoyed systematic games and building, but I could also get messy and color outside the lines so to speak. This continued as I grew up, I was creative, but neat.</p>
          <h2>College</h2>
            <p>I was enthralled in my art and continued this in college where I received my bachelors of fine arts. I studied graphic arts, painting, drawing, sculpture, and printmaking. I mostly enjoyed printmaking. There was a process and system before you could begin creating. There was a set up of sketching; carving a plate; laying out inks, rollers, and pallet knives; preparing the paper in a water bath; rolling out the ink to just the right consistency; and then finally putting that ink to plate and through the press on paper. I enjoyed the art because I enjoyed the process.</p>
          <h2>Restaurants</h2>
            <p>While working in restaurants I learned how to make people happy and create a positive experience for the guests and co-workers. Some people need a lot of attention and some people want to be left alone and neither of them will tell you upfront. I would anticipate their needs before they knew they had them. It was a skill that I take into all of my projects now.</p>
          <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p>I started teaching art to the younger generation at first just teaching a few classes and then eventually creating an art department at a charter school and teaching grades K-8. I was creating projects, managing 30 students at a time on my own, and handling supply orders with budgets. My patience grew immensely and my organizational skills were enhanced more than I thought they could be.</p>
          <h2>UX/UI</h2>
            <p class="lastp">I was interested in a career where I could incorporate my organizational skills, my love for process, and my creativity. I thought that switching over to graphic design would make the most sense. The more I looked into graphic design roles the more I learned about UX/UI Design. The more I looked into UX/UI Design the more I knew it would be a great fit. Design is important to me because it’s self reflection. You are able to let something inside of you out. UX/UI is a way to explore yourself, but equally importantly it is a way to understand the connections and relations of users.</p>
