          <!--- INTRODUCTION -->
        <div class="introduction">
          <h2>What it is</h2>
          <p>TV TELL is an application for sharing T.V. shows with friends. You’re able to share through the app by sending and receiving “TELLs”. You can keep track of the shows you want to watch by creating WATCH lists.</p>
          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>The endless scroll of finding something to watch can be daunting. There are so many TV shows and you want to watch something that is recommended by someone who knows your taste. You need a place to keep track of the shows that you plan to watch and get recommendations from friends.</p>
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>TVTELL is an application that will store your shows and filter by the channels you have access to. You can send and receive shows easily through the app, so you never have to face the endless show scroll again.</p>

          <h2>Survey</h2>
            <p>To create this application I wanted to get some input from people who watch TV shows. My main goal was to find out how they get recommendations, how they save or remember their recommendations and if they like what they're doing.</p>

              <p class="ipadp">Now that I knew what the high priority tasks were, I created user flows to better understand the flow of the application I was to create.

              <p>By creating user flows I was able to have a clear vision into the functionality of my designs. I then moved into sketching wire frames and transfering my sketches into vector design in figma.</p>

              <p>TVTELL is a fun leisure application and I wanted the brand to reflect that. I incorporated simple, yet modern color and shapes.</p>

              <p>For the shape of the logo I referenced mega phones. I warped the letters to appear as if they were coming out of a megaphone. This coincides with someone sending a “TELL”.</p>

                <br>
                  <p>After creating sketches I chose a few to work digitally using Figma and Photoshop. I then created a preference test with four of them.</p>

                <img class="tvcenterimg" src="img/tvpreference.png" alt="4 tvtell logo vector drawings">

                <p>I learned from the preference test that 60% of the 25 people I tested preferred the bottom left logo. I moved forward with this design until my user testing gave feedback that the design was flat and the colors did not fit within the application. I then adjusted the logo as you can see below.<p>

                <p>I experimented with many color pallets including a retro 70s feel and neon glow. I was most inspired by the color test from TV sets. I wanted to incorporate those vibrant colors with the neon and on trend gradients used today. </p>

                <h2>Hi-Fi Mockup</h2>
                <p>From the wireframes I added icons, color, and referred to my style guide for text and sizing. I wanted the call to actions on the screen to be obvious to the user so I sparingly used color aside for the call to action icons and buttons.  I also wanted to include a features page with the same icons on the landing page. This proved to be helpful to a user who used it as a guide for what the icons meant.</p>

                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                <p>After testing the first hi-fi mock up I noticed users were confused by the TELLs. They had a hard time deciphering if the TELLs were from them or for them. Also, one tester felt the homepage as a new user was unmotivating. A new user would not have any TELLs ready for them because they just signed up. However, there are no action steps for them to change this. I remedied this situation by updating the homepage.</p>

            <h2 class="casestudysection">Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="spacer">
            </div>
              <p>The problem of the endless scroll and mismanagement of reccomendations for TV shows has been solved with TVTELL. <b>The application is successful because it created a space for friends to share and save recommendations.</b></p>
              <p>When I first started to create the application I knew there would be a lot of features that would be neat to incorporate. I did not want to go down the road to scope creep, so I stuck to my most viable products. With each screen I asked, how does this help the user see, save, or share. I incorporated <b>solid infastructure to assure the user would have access to the MVPs</b> at all time. The bottom toolbar created an ever present simple navigation system to support this notion.</b></p>
              <p>After testing a few changes needed to be made. Mainly to make the user easily understand what a “TELL” is as it is a new terminology that was confusing to users at first. I did this by <b>combining the TELL with something familiar, an inbox.</b> Users are familiar with message and inboxes. When they can interpret the TELL as a message they can better understand the concept of the application and new terminology.</p>
              <p>During this project I learned to <b>test thoroughly and specifically.</b> The high fiidelity mock ups need to be tested early in order to catch changes that could affect the functioning of the application. I did this by specifically <b>testing for the most viable products in multiple ways</b> throughout the users experience on the application.</p>
